Two months back, I was not interested in writing a blog. But, I definitely wanted to start a YouTube channel. However, still I couldn't shoot a single video. One day, after seeing my friend Ramith's blog, I thought it's better to start writing and then move on to do videos for YouTube. So thanks to my good friend Ramith now I write blogs and I'm supper exited about this!</p><p>Mostly, I'll write about the tech stuff that I come across in my studies like robotics, computer vision, machine learning, electronics and other cool stuff I see in internet. Hopefully this will be a great platform that connects you and me! </p><p>See you next time! Â </p>]]&gt;</encoded></item></channel>
