There were few features that we looked for when selecting a micro-controller.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li>Physical size</li>
<li>Memory</li>
<li>Number of GPIO pins</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
</ol>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>To be honest, we couldn't find a micro-controller which ticks all the boxes for us. But there were few micro-controller that we  found very useful in this case.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li>STM32F103C8 - Blue pill</li>
<li>Arduino pro mini</li>
<li>Arduino Geniuno Uno</li>
<li>Arduino nano</li>
</ol>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the Arduino boards that we found, there were few disadvantages when used in a micro mouse. Some were large in size(Arduino Uno), some didn't have enough GPIO pins(specially external interrupt pins ) and some didn't have enough memory to store the micro mouse maze solving algorithm. </p><p>After two three rounds of discussions in the team, we decided to use STM32 blue pill as the micro-controller. The initial concern was how to program this blue pill. Luckily, STM32 is programable trough the very familiar Arduino IDE. Overall STM32 is a good choice when compared with others. The small physical size and more GPIO pins are very valuable when building a micro mouse.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/08/stm32f103-pinout-diagram.png" class="kg-image" alt="STM32 - Brain of PICCOLA (micromouse part 01)"><figcaption>STM32F103C8 pin diagram</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Since this is Arduino compatible, we can use all the libraries available for Arduino without any problem(STM32 programing will be talked in a separate post ).  </p><p>This is a series of posts where I'm trying to talk about building a micro mouse from scratch.

However, still I couldn't shoot a single video.</p><p>One day, after seeing my friend Ramith's blog, I thought it's better to start writing and then move on to do videos for YouTube. So thanks to my good friend Ramith now I write blogs and I'm supper exited about this!</p><p>Mostly, I'll write about the tech stuff that I come across in my studies like robotics, computer vision, machine learning, electronics and other cool stuff I see in internet. Hopefully this will be a great platform that connects you and me! </p><p>See you next time!  </p>]]&gt;</encoded></item></channel>
