The advantage of having such a communication protocol is, we can use same communication bus to communicate with multiple modules. On the other hand, to successfully communicate with multiple modules, first we need to identify those modules individually. To do that, we use unique addresses for each of the modules. After that, by referring to that unique address we can communicate with multiple modules without any interruption.</p><!--kg-card-begin: gallery--><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/08/Capture-1.PNG" width="782" height="450" alt="Multiple VL6180X(Pololu) with Arduino"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/08/Capture1.PNG" width="1429" height="737" alt="Multiple VL6180X(Pololu) with Arduino"></div></div></div><figcaption>source : <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/2489">Pololu</a></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: gallery--><p>First, let's see how pins are connected with Arduino</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>VL6180X &gt; Arduino<br>

GND &gt; GND<br>
SDA &gt; SDA<br>
SCL &gt; SCL<br>
GPIO0 &gt; Any digital/analog pin</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>SDA and SCL are common for all the sensors. But GPIO0 should be connected individually to the Arduino board. Here, we will be using 5 VL6180X sensors with a Arduino Uno. </p><p><strong>Now, the problem is how to unique addresses for these 5 sensors</strong>. VL6180X sensors by Pololu have this pin called GPIO0 and here we will be using this pin to make the sensors hardware stand-by(usually other sensor manufacturers name this pin as XSHUT). By default GPIO0 is at VDD voltage level(HIGH). By making this pin LOW we can put the sensor to stand-by mode. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/08/Capture2.PNG" class="kg-image" alt="Multiple VL6180X(Pololu) with Arduino"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>To write addresses to all the five sensors, first by making all the 5 GPIO0 pins LOW, we put sensors into stand-by mode. After that, by making each pin HIGH one by one we can write I2C addresses to the sensors(here the addresses are 43,44,45,46,47).</p>]]&gt;</encoded></item><item><title></title><description>Sharp IR of ToF ?

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>However. both sharp IR and ToF sensors have above features and that makes difficult to take a decision.</p><p>For the micro mouse that we were building, we wanted the sensors to be able take measurements in the range 10mm - 200mm with very high accuracy. Since we were not planning to run the micro mouse in very high speeds, the speed of the sensors was not a concern. But we wanted our micro mouse to be small as possible and since were planning to use five sensors, size of the sensors was one of the major concerns.</p><p>For all our requirements, we found that <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/2489">VL6180X by Pololu</a> is the one we needed. However, the only issue we had with <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/2450">sharp IR sensors</a> is their size. (we were looking at the sharp IR sensor modules. Physical size won't matter if IR emitters and receivers are taken separately)</p><p>In one of the next posts, I'll be talking about interfacing multiple VL6180X with STM32F103C8 using Arduino. Stay tuned for that.</p><p>See you next time!</p>]]&gt;</encoded></item><item><title></title><description>Team Piccola !

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>To be honest, we couldn't find a micro-controller which ticks all the boxes for us. But there were few micro-controller that we  found very useful in this case.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li>STM32F103C8 - Blue pill</li>
<li>Arduino pro mini</li>
<li>Arduino Geniuno Uno</li>
<li>Arduino nano</li>
</ol>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the Arduino boards that we found, there were few disadvantages when used in a micro mouse. Some were large in size(Arduino Uno), some didn't have enough GPIO pins(specially external interrupt pins ) and some didn't have enough memory to store the micro mouse maze solving algorithm. </p><p>After two three rounds of discussions in the team, we decided to use STM32 blue pill as the micro-controller. The initial concern was how to program this blue pill. Luckily, STM32 is programable trough the very familiar Arduino IDE. Overall STM32 is a good choice when compared with others. The small physical size and more GPIO pins are very valuable when building a micro mouse.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/08/stm32f103-pinout-diagram.png" class="kg-image" alt="STM32 - Brain of PICCOLA (micromouse part 01)"><figcaption>STM32F103C8 pin diagram</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Since this is Arduino compatible, we can use all the libraries available for Arduino without any problem(STM32 programing will be talked in a separate post ).  </p><p>This is a series of posts where I'm trying to talk about building a micro mouse from scratch.
